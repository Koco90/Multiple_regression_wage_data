## Multiple Regression on Wage Data from a Hospital

#### After the data has been cleaned, the following plots are created:
+ Position(0 for hospital and 1 for office worker) against hourly wage
+ Age against hourly wage
+ Years worked against hourly wage

#### A multiple linear regression model is then used on all the variables

#### A train test split of 80:20 is used
